    <h1>Sean Washington</h1>

    <p>Welcome! I'm a software developer based out of üèù Santa Cruz, CA. I've been building software since early 2012, with the bulk of my experience being on the web platform. I'm currently building tools to empower interior designers, both big at small, at
        <a href="https://onsidedoor.com">SideDoor</a>.</p>

    <p>Before SideDoor, I co-hosted the <a href="https://dnc.show">Does Not Compute</a> Podcast, built (the now-defunct)
        <a href="https://designkollective.com">Design Kollective</a>, and was an Engineering Lead at
        <a href="https://metalab.com">MetaLab</a>.</p>

    <p>Check out my <a href="https://seanwash.com">Changelog</a>, or find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/seanwashbot">Twitter</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/seanwash">GitHub</a>.</p>
